Right now I'm just trying to make the menu interact as it normally would with some limitations I deem necessary  
(No table selection, No payment of checks (maybe later??), etc.) 

Currently Working on:   
* Modify menu (Bar and Food)

Upcoming (In no particular order): 
* Yellow bar functionality
* Grey bar functionality
* Order screen format
* Send
* Voiding
* Reorder
* Previous Screen
* Time specific stuff (Daily Specials, happy hour)
* Upcomming Price Change
