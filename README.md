Right now I'm just trying to make the menu interact as it normally would with some limitations I deem necessary  
(No table selection, No payment of checks (maybe later??), etc.) 

Currently Working on:   

Upcoming (In no particular order):  
* Yellow bar functionality
* Order screen format
* Send
* Remove last
* Voiding
* Reorder
* Modify menu
* Previous Screen
* Special Submenus(TM Salad Combo,Rellenos,Combo Tacos/Enchiladas, #4 Combo, Ala Taco/Ench/Rell)
* Time specific stuff (Daily Specials, happy hour)
